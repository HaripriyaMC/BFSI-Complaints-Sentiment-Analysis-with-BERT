# BFSI Customer Complaints Analysis Using BERT for Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer complaints in the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), we aim to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback, helping organizations understand customer sentiments and improve their services.

## Objectives
- To collect and preprocess customer complaint data from the BFSI sector.
- To implement BERT for sentiment classification of complaints into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.
- To evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- To visualize the results and provide insights for improving customer experience in the BFSI industry.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing pipeline for customer complaints.
- Implementation of BERT for sentiment analysis.
- Detailed classification reports and confusion matrix visualizations.
- User-friendly interface for predicting the sentiment of new complaints.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BERT (from the Hugging Face Transformers library)
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
